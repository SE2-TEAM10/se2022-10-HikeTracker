TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 10)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done 1 vs. 1
- Total points committed vs. done 8 vs. 8
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team) 66h vs. 52h 30m

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|-------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_  | 7       |        | 29h        | 29h          |
| _#1_  | 7       | 8      | 18h 30m    | 25h 15m      |
   

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
    - Average estime: 2h 38m
    - Average actual: 3h 36m
    - Deviation estime: 1h 45m
    - Deviation actual: 3h 14m
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1
    - Result: 0.365

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 2h
  - Total hours spent: 2h
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 1
  - Coverage (if available): 60%
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 3h
  - Total hours spent: 3h
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated:3h
  - Total hours spent: 3h
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
    - We made the estimation before asking all the important clarifications for the stories.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

    - We need to ask everything that needs to be clarified
    - BE and FE have to start simultaneously, so that we can work faster.
    - Each person has to work on all the estimated stories.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
    - We did the planning earlier than before but it was also too early.
    - We did unit tests.

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why? 
    - We did create more and smaller tasks but we can still improve this.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
    - Planning at the right time and work simultaneously

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - Team working and communication were fine ;)
